couchdb-node - a CouchDB wrapper for Node.js
============================================

I wrote this in the course of a day or two, when I got the idea to switch one
of my personal projects from MongoDB to CouchDB. I later changed my mind, so
this is an incomplete library.

It uses [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q), so the interface is of promises
and such. This was a great learning experience for me! It might complicate your
plans to use this library, however.

**This library is not in npm.**

Usage
-----

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

Run JShint and Nodeunit:

    grunt jshint nodeunit

Use the file inside the src/ directory.
